## Live Migration of runc Containers Using CRIU

This is the landing page for my ([Carlos Segarra](https://carlossegarra.com)) MSc Thesis Project.
Under the supervision of [Jordi Guitart](http://people.ac.upc.edu/jguitart/), we are working on live migration of runc containers using [CRIU (Checkpoint Restore in Userspace)](https://criu.org/Main_Page).

The source code can be found in the `migration` directory.
The `runc-containers` directory contains specs for different applications we will use in our benchmarking.

If you want to contact me you can do so at `carlos` dot `segarra` at `estudiant.upc.edu`.
