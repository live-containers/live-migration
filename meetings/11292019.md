### To-Do 1

0. **Freeze at a current OS + Kernel + Docker + CRIU version:**
	- Kernel: 4.19.0-6
	- OS: Debian 10 (buster)
	- Docker version: 19.03.5
	- Criu Version: 3.12
1. **Get the simple server example to work:**
	- Different error with this installation, after inspecting the log files I find:
		Error: inet: Connected TCP socket, consider using --tcp-established option.
	- Doing a bit of research [(see here)](https://github.com/checkpoint-restore/criu/issues/599) I created a `/etc/criu/runc.conf` file with `tcp-established`. Then checkpoint works, but it does not preserve the state.
2. **Keep running option:**
	- `docker checkpoint create --leave-running`
3. **Be able to start from a different container:**
	- Technically you should be able to specify a checkpoint dir using:
		docker checkpoint create --checkpoint-dir=/tmp
		docker create --name clone
		docker start --checkpoint-dir --checkpoint cp clone
	- Currently however I get an error when starting the container:
		Error response from daemon: custom checkpointdir is not supported.
	- This seems to be a known issue and not supported (broken at some point in the past) see [1](https://github.com/checkpoint-restore/criu/issues/450), [2](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/35691#issuecomment-378662566), [3](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/37344#issuecomment-450782189).
	- The only problem is restoring from a custom directory, there is a hacky workaround (btw, no need for the `--security-opt seccomp:unconfined` flag)
		docker build -t criu-looper .
		docker run -d --name looper criu-looper
		docker checkpoint create --checkpoint-dir /tmp looper cp1
		docker create --name looper-clone criu-looper
		mv /tmp/cp1 /var/lib/docker/containers/$(docker ps -aq --no-trunc --filter name=looper-clone)/checkpoints/
		docker start --checkpoint cp1 looper-clone
	- There are PR trying to fix this properly but does not seem doable atm.

## To-Do 2

0. Live migration as a command line argument
    + Generally, files living in `docker-ce/components/cli`
    + Adding the option in the completion file:
    + docker checkpoint migrate <name-container> <new-name>

1. Disk-less migration as a command line 
2. Get the example to work:
    + Current implementation relies on the stack
